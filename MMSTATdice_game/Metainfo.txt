Description : 'Shows the conditional probability that the dice is either fair or loaded given the number of rolled sixes (X) in the upper panel. The lower panel shows a bar plot of the conditional probability to roll a specific number of sixes given a fair/loaded dice. The user can interactively choose (1) the number of rolls, (2) the number of rolled sixes for the upper panel and (3) the probability to roll a six with the loaded dice.'
